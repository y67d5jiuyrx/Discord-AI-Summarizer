# Discord AI Summarizer Bot

This Discord bot analyzes and summarizes conversations in a specified channel using AI, powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model.

</div>

## Features

- **Summarization:** Automatically generates a summary of messages in a Discord channel.
- **Permission Control:** Only users with a specified role can invoke the summarization command.
- **Embeds:** Sends the summary as an embed message, including details like the number of messages analyzed and the time range.
- **Customizable AI Model:** By default, the bot uses `gpt-3.5-turbo`, but you can switch to `gpt-4` for a more in-depth analysis (at a higher API cost).

## Usage

Once the bot is running and added to your Discord server, users with the specified role can use the `/summarize` command in any channel to generate a summary.

### Command Usage

- `/summarize <channel_mention> <message_count>`: Summarizes the last `message_count` messages in the specified `channel_mention`.

### Example

To summarize the last 50 messages in a channel:

```
/summarize #general 50
```

## Customizing the AI Model

By default, the bot uses `gpt-3.5-turbo`, which is optimized for speed and cost efficiency. However, for a more detailed and nuanced analysis, you can change the model to `gpt-4` in `main.py`:

```python
response = bot.openai_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",  # Change "gpt-3.5-turbo" to "gpt-4" for better accuracy
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a professional conversation analyst. Create a detailed summary of this Discord conversation.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Analyze this conversation and provide a comprehensive summary:\n\n{conversation}",
        },
    ],
    temperature=0.5,
    max_tokens=2000,
)
```

### ⚠️ Note:
- **GPT-4 provides better, more context-aware summaries**, but **it costs more per API request**.
- Consider using GPT-3.5 for general use and switching to GPT-4 only when necessary.
